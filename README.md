## Notes on study strategy:

As noted on the exam's content, the most asked questions are about perform operations on quantum circuits(47%), quantum information (10%) and constructing visualizations (19%).  We suggest focusing on those topics. We also suggest the use of flashcards (linked above), as they are more focused on sintax and more reliant on memory.

Of course, practice makes perfect! If possible, consider participating in quantum Hackatons or working on problems from Qiskit Textbook.

**Good luck on your test!**
